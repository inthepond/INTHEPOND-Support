        <h1>Ruce Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Ruce ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Information such as your name, email address, gender, and date of birth if you choose to provide it for profile creation or personalized features.</li>
            <li><strong>Health & Wellness Data:</strong> Information you input regarding your TCM constitution, bowel habits, hydration, emotional states, and menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Data from Bamai App:</strong> If you choose to connect Ruce with the Bamai app, Ruce will receive pulse analysis data from Bamai to enhance personalized recommendations. This data transfer only occurs with your explicit consent.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your personal and health data is primarily stored locally on your device. If cloud backup or synchronization features are offered and you opt-in, your data will be encrypted during transit and at rest on secure servers. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
